        <p>My name is Sophie Teal. I am a first year Graphic Design student here at Algonquin. Before this I studied visual art at an art school for four years. Iâ€™ve always been someone who loves drawing and various other forms of visual art, but it was at that school where my love for anything art or design related really flourished.</p>
        <p>Some hobbies of mine include reading, watching movies, listening to music, indulging in nature and of course, creating art. My favourite art forms are pencil drawing and ceramics. I like collecting things like perfumes, jewellery and Lego. I am 100 percent a cat person and have the cutest cat named Fisher. I speak English and French, and am currently trying to learn Hebrew on Duolingo.</p>
